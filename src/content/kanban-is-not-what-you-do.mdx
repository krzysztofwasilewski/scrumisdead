excerpt: "Kanban isn’t Scrum minus sprints. It’s discipline disguised as flow—and too often, abused as an excuse."

Kanban has been hijacked. What was designed as a system of **flow, feedback, and relentless improvement** has been watered down into a convenient dodge: no sprints, no deadlines, no promises—just an endless conveyor belt of “in progress” that never seems to arrive.

This is not Kanban. This is **escape pageant**.

At its core, Kanban is not a hall pass out of planning. It is not Scrum stripped of sprints, accountability quietly erased in the name of “flexibility.” It is a discipline:

- **Visualize the work.** Make the invisible tangible so the team sees reality together.
- **Limit work in progress.** Force choices. Constrain multitasking. Reveal bottlenecks.
- **Manage flow.** Measure cycle times, throughput, lead times—not for vanity, but to tune the system.
- **Make policies explicit.** No hidden rules, no arbitrary gates. Clarity is culture.
- **Feedback loops.** Stand-ups, replenishment, retrospectives—rhythms to sense and adapt.
- **Continuous improvement.** Small experiments, constant nudges, evolution by design.

This is Kanban: not chaos, but **constraint**. Not laziness, but **discipline**. Not avoidance, but **exposure**—of where the system resists, where it slows, where it hides work.

Yet too many teams brandish “we’re doing Kanban” as a get-out-of-jail-free card. They skip planning because “Kanban is continuous.” They dodge commitments because “delivery dates don’t fit Kanban.” They avoid accountability because “flow is unpredictable.” In truth, they’ve turned Kanban into camouflage: a way to appear agile while never being accountable. And that makes me sick.

Real Kanban doesn’t eliminate responsibility—it sharpens it. By making flow visible, it removes excuses. By measuring reality, it challenges optimism. By confronting the uncomfortable truth of how long things **really** take, it demands ownership. That discomfort is the point.

Kanban is not Scrum minus sprints. Kanban is management without illusion. Done right, it is more ruthless than Scrum, because it strips away the ceremony and leaves you staring straight at your system’s flaws. No backlog grooming sessions to pretend progress. No sprint rituals to mask indecision. Just flow—or the painful absence of it.

To misuse Kanban as an excuse is to miss its power entirely. To embrace Kanban is to accept that accountability lives not in ceremonies or commitments, but in the unflinching honesty of the work itself.
